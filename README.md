# learn-frontend  
This is the repo recording the process of me trying to learn frontend development as an absolute noob -- well, probably not really absolute noob -- so if you have no idea of what frontend development is about, you might find it helpful.  
## How I'm learning  
1. Find out what I need to learn on the famous roadmap : [The roadmap of frontend development](https://roadmap.sh/frontend)
2. Follow the tutorials on [Traversy Media](https://www.youtube.com/@TraversyMedia/featured) , search and check the concepts that I don't understand on Google and [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/)
3. Try to implement whatever comes to my mind and have some fun...
